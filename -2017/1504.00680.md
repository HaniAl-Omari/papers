# Antisocial Behavior in Online Discussion Communities, Cheng et al., 2015

## [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00680), Tags: \#social-sciences

In this paper we characterize antisocial behavior in 3 large online discussion communities by analyzing users who were banned from these. Such users tend to concentrate their efforts in a small number of threads, are more likely to post irrelevantly, and are more successful at garnering responses from other users. They write worse than other users, and become increasingly less tolerated by the community. We use these insights to identify antisocial users early on.
