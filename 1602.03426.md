# Automatic Sarcasm Detection: A Survey, Joshi et al., 2017

## [Paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3124420), Tags: \#sarcasm-detection

This paper is the first known compilation of past work in automatic sarcasm detection. We observe 3 milestones in research so far: semi-supervised pattern extraction to identify implicit sentiment, use of hashtag-based supervision, and use of context beyond target etxt.

We describe datasets, approaches, trends and issues in sarcasm detection, and discuss representative performance values, shared tasks and pointers to future work.

## Introduction

Free dictionary: sarcasm is a form of verbal irony intended to express contempt or ridicule. It has an implied neative sentiment, but a positive surface sentiment.

Our paper looks at sarcasm detection in six steps: problem formulation, datasets, approaches, reported performance, trends and issues.

## Sarcasm studies in linguistics

Several representations and taxonomies for sarcasm have been proposed:

1. Campbell and Katz 2012, state that sarcasm occurs along several dimensions, namely failed expectation, pragmatic insincerity, negative tension and presence of a victim
2. Camp 2012 show that there are 4 types of sarcasm:
    * Propositional: appears to be a non-sentiment proposition but has an implicit sentiment involved
    * Embedded: embedded sentiment incongruity in the form of words and phrases themselves
    * Like-prefixed: a like-phrase provides an implied denial of the argument being made
    * Illocutionary: involves non-textual clues indicating than an attitude opposite to a sincere utterance.
3. 6-tuple representation: Ivanko and Pexman 2003 define sarcasm as a 6-tuple consisting of speaker, hearer/listener, context, utterance, literal proposition, intended proposition.
4. Eisterhold et al. 2006 state that sarcasm can be understood in terms of the response it elicits: laughter, zero response, smile, sarcasm in return, a change of topic, literal reply and non-verbal reactions.
5. Situational disparity theory: Wilson 2006 says that sarcasm arises when there's situational disparity between text and a contextual information
6. Negation theory of sarcasm: Giora 1995 state that irony/sarcasm is a form of negation in which an explicit negation marker is lacking.

## Problem definition

The most common formulation for sarcasm detection is a classification task, to predict whether the text is sarcastic or not.

Other studies such as Joshi et al., 2016 model sarcasm as a sequence labeling task. Each utterance in a dialogue is considered to be an observed unit in this sequence, whereas sarcasm labels are the hidden variables whose values need to be predicted.

Ghosh et al. 2015a model sarcasm detection as a sense disambiguation task, they state that a word may have a literal sense and a sarcastic sense and their goal is to identify the sense of a word in order to detect sarcasm.

Most research in sarcasm detection exists for English, but some research in the following language has also been reported: chinese, italian, czech, dutch, greek, indonesian and hindi.

## Datasets

We divide three classes of datasets, short text (typically characterized by noise and situations where length is limited by the platform, as in tweets), long text (discussion forum posts), and other datasets.

### Short text

The main approach for sarcasm detection in tweets is manual annotation, or hashtag-based supervision, which offers some benefits: no one but the author can determine if it was sarcastic, and the approach allows creation of large-scale datasets.

### Long text

Reviews and discussion forum posts have also been used as sarcasm-labeled datasets. Most studies use a dataset of discussion forum posts with multiple labels, one of them being sarcasm. Reviews from Amazon products have been used as well.

### Other datasets

Other datasets include call center transcripts, and 'yeah right's are marked as sarcastic or not. Sentences from an MTV show or TV series have also been used.

## Approaches

### Rule-based approaches

These approaches attempt to identify sarcasm through specific evidences, rules that rely on indicators of sarcasm. They present an error analysis corresponding to a multiple rules. Hashtag tokenizers, parse-based lexicon generation algorithm, hyperbole capture, rule-based classifiers looking for a positive verb and a negative situation.

### Statistical approaches

These approaches vary in terms of features and learning algorithms

* Features used: most of them use bag-of-words, contextual features too. Sentiment lexicon based-features, pragmatic features like emoticons and user mentions, ambiguity features, skip-gram..
* Learning algorithms: SVM, SVM with SMO and logistic regression, Naive Bayes, etc. (2015)
* Deep learning based approaches: similarity between word embeddings as features, similarity of word embeddings related to most congruent and incongruent word pairs. An improvement with LSTM followed by a DNN is also reported.

## Trends in sarcasm detection

### Pattern discovery

Discovering sarcastic patterns was an early trend in sarcasm detection. Tsur et al. 2010 extract sarcastic patterns from a seed set of labeled sentences. They first select words that either occur more than an upper threshold or less than a lower threshold.

Other studies hypothesize that sarcasm occurs due to a contrast between positive verbs and negative situation phrases.

### Role of context in sarcasm detection

Context here refers to any information beyond the text to be predicted, and beyond common knowledge. Three types of context have been reported:

* Author-specific context: textual footprint of the author of the target text. Khattri et al. 2015 follow the intuition that a tweet is sarcastic either because it has words of contrasting sentiment in it, or because there's sentiment that contrasts with the author's historical sentiment. Historical tweets by the same author are considered as the context.
* Conversation context: text in the conversation of which the target text is a part, the discourse structure of a conversation
* Topical context: this follows the intuition that some topics are likely to evolve sarcasm more commonly than others

## Issues in sarcasm detection

### Issues with data

Hashtag-based labeling can provide large-scale supervision, but the quality of the dataset may be doubtful, because of the use of the hashtag #not, which is used to denote sarcasm even if the sentence before isn't sarcastic.

### Issues with features

Many studies deliberate if sentiment can be used as a feature for sarcasm detection, some models use sentiment as an input to the sarcasm classifier, but these require 'surface polarity', the apparent polarity of a sentence.

### Dealing with dataset skews

Sarcasm is an infrequent phenomenon of sentiment expression. This skew also reflects in datasets, most of the entries in the dataset are non-sarcastic while very few are sarcastic.

## Conclusion

We observed 3 milestones in the history of sarcasm detection research: semi-supervised pattern extraction to identify implicit sentiment, use of hashtag-based supervision, and use of context beyond target text.

We also highlight three issues in sarcasm detection: the relationship between sentiment and sarcasm, and data skew in case of sarcasm-labeled dataset.

Based on our survey, we propose following possible directions for future:

1. Implicit sentiment detection and sarcasm: it's established that sarcasm is closely linked to sentiment incongruity, so detecting implicit sentiment should help.
2. Incongruity in numbers
3. Coverage of different forms of sarcasm: in section 2 we explore 4 types of sarcasm, propositional, lexical, like-prefixed and illocutionary sarcasm. Current work focuses only on the last two.
4. Culture-specific aspects of sarcasm detection
5. Deep learning-based architectures
